    <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>
          My name is Joshua and I’m serving in the United States Air Force as a systems administrator. Born in Dover, Delaware in 1988, I moved to multiple states until settling in New Hampshire at the age of 5. I lived on the edge of the White Mountains in New Hampshire in a town that had just over one thousand people. I took in interest in technology from the start but maintained an active social life and was employed early on in my life. I worked as a lifeguard at 15 and as a cashier until I was 18. Upon graduating high school, I joined the Air Force. While the Air Force wasn’t my first choice, I felt it was best choice as it enabled me to earn money while receiving my education using tuition assistance.

          The Air Force has taken me all over the world, starting in Oklahoma all the way to Germany. Oklahoma wasn’t my favorite but that was balanced out by how amazing Germany was. I couldn’t begin to tell you all the things I loved about Germany but some of my favorite things were the castles scattered all over the country, the cobblestone villages with quaint restraints and shops, the endless road biking trails, and access to travel around Europe. After spending three years in Germany, I made my way back to the states and now I live in northern Virginia. I love the D.C. area and all the things that I can do here. While people complain about the traffic, I have access to some of the best museums, parks, harbors, and historical places. I also met my now wife making this my favorite place.
